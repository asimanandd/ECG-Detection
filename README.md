# ECG-Detection


This project focuses on detecting R-peaks in ECG (electrocardiogram) signals, which is important for identifying and monitoring heart-related issues. It reviews and compares three commonly used methods: the wavelet transform, the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, and the Hilbert transform.

The aim is to understand how each method works, along with their advantages and disadvantages. This helps researchers and medical professionals choose the best method for accurate ECG analysis and effective heart condition monitoring.
